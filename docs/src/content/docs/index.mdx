<Faq
  faqs={[
    {
      question: "What is llms.txt and why do I need it?",
      answer:
        "llms.txt is a community standard file that helps AI models better understand and index your site. It provides a structured format that LLMs can easily parse, making your docs more discoverable and useful when users interact with AI assistants.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does this plugin work with all Starlight themes?",
      answer:
        "Yes! The plugin is designed to work seamlessly with any Starlight theme. It integrates with Starlight's built-in components and styling system, so it will automatically match your site's look and feel.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize which actions appear on my pages?",
      answer:
        "Yes! You have full control over which actions are displayed. You can show or hide any of the default actions and add your own custom actions to match your specific needs and workflow.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is the Markdown generated?",
      answer:
        "The plugin uses vite-plugin-static-copy to create copies of your .md and .mdx files. This exposes the original Markdown files, making them accessible and ready to be consumed by LLMs or copied by users while preserving all formatting, code blocks, and structure.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is the llms.txt file generated?",
      answer:
        "The llms.txt file is automatically generated from your Starlight sidebar configuration. The plugin reads your sidebar structure and creates a properly formatted llms.txt file that maps your documentation hierarchy, making it easy for LLMs to understand and navigate your content. In cases where the sidebar uses certain configurations like the autogenerate prop, the sidebar structure cannot be fully processed yet, so all pages are listed directly in a flat list instead of following the hierarchy.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I disable page actions on specific pages?",
      answer:
        "Yes! You can disable page actions on individual pages using frontmatter configuration. This is useful for pages that aren't ideal for LLM consumption, such as changelogs, legal documents, release notes, or any content that doesn't benefit from AI interaction.",
