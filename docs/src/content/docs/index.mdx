    {
      question: "What is llms.txt and why do I need it?",
      answer:
        "llms.txt is a community standard file that helps AI models better understand and index your site. It provides a structured format that LLMs can easily parse, making your docs more discoverable and useful when users interact with AI assistants.",

      question: "Does this plugin work with all Starlight themes?",

    },
    {
      question: "How is the Markdown generated?",
      answer:
        "The plugin uses vite-plugin-static-copy to create copies of your .md and .mdx files during the build process. This exposes the original Markdown files, making them accessible and ready to be consumed by LLMs or copied by users while preserving all formatting, code blocks, and structure.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is the llms.txt file generated?",
      answer:
        "The llms.txt file is automatically generated from your Starlight sidebar configuration. The plugin reads your sidebar structure and creates a properly formatted llms.txt file that maps your documentation hierarchy, making it easy for LLMs to understand and navigate your content.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this plugin free?",
      answer:
        "Yes, the plugin is open source and free to use. You can find it on npm and GitHub.",
