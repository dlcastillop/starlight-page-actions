By default, page actions are enabled on all documentation pages. You can disable them on specific pages by extending the frontmatter schema and setting the `pageActions` property to `false`.

## How to disable page actions per page

<Steps>

1. You need to extend the Starlight schema in your `content.config.ts` file to include the `pageActions` property.

   ```diff lang="ts"
   // content.config.ts
    import { defineCollection } from "astro:content";
    import { docsLoader } from "@astrojs/starlight/loaders";

    export const collections = {
      docs: defineCollection({
        loader: docsLoader(),
   +     schema: docsSchema({
   +      extend: z.object({
   +       pageActions: z.boolean().optional().default(true),
   +      }),
   +    }),
      }),
    };
   ```

2. Once you've extended the schema, you can disable page actions on any page by adding `pageActions: false` to the frontmatter.

   ```mdx

   Your page content here...
   ```

</Steps>

:::note
The `pageActions` property defaults to `true`, so you only need to add it to pages where you want to disable the actions. All other pages will continue to show page actions normally.
