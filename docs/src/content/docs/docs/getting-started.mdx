Starlight Page Actions is a Starlight plugin to add common page actions like the ones you see up here.

- Copy to markdown
- Open docs with ChatGPT and Claude
- See raw mardown file

Aditionally, this plugin will generate the llms.txt file for the site.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up. If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

<Steps>

1. Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

   <Tabs syncKey="pkg">

   <TabItem label="npm">

   ```sh
   npm install starlight-page-actions
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="yarn">

   ```sh
   yarn add starlight-page-actions
   ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="pnpm">

   ```sh
   pnpm add starlight-page-actions
   ```

   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight configuration in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightPageActions from 'starlight-page-actions'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
   +      plugins: [starlightPageActions()],
         title: 'My Docs',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. Start the development server to preview the plugin in action.
